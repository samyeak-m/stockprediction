i will give all thee codessssssssss of my project
dont use any library or frame work i want code in advance hardcore java, i dont need simplify logic version i need advance logic with implementation,
can you give me all java code for stock prediction of nepse with lstm algorithm using relu activation function, if there is simgoid in my project replace it with relu

PROBLEM : in this project the prediction is always 0 actual     : 282.48085386990033
prediction : 0.0
prediction : NaN
actual     : 636.0873159468063
prediction : NaN
actual     : 217.34822064869533
prediction : NaN
actual     : 260.8273335699135
prediction : NaN
Jun 26, 2024 7:49:26 AM Main trainModel
INFO: Epoch 2: Accuracy = 0.0000, Loss = NaN, Time = 193662 ms

and accuracy and loss is nan and also same in every epoch

i have dataset on database under table daily_data_stockname where stockname is symbol of stock listed on nepse need to train model test model graph for data visualization preprocess dataset to 60% for train model and leftover for test and perform EDA analysis on the dataset
Seasonal analysis of the time series data
Splitting the data into training and testing.
Scaling our data to perform computations in a fast and accurate manner.
Processing to a time series generation
define the architecture of the model
all thing in java maven project
and also need to save prediction on database under table prediction

do all necessary thing to get accuracy price predict and train model to always predict accurate price

NOTE : i need full code with all thing using database name nepse_test, i need code which i can just copy and past in my project

did you get it if you have any question ask


here is my full code analyzed whole code, save it in memory and solve problem using my code
